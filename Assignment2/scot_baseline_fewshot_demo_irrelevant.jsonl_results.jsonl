The actual implementation may involve more details such as handling edge cases, optimizing the search process, and ensuring that the path is valid (i.e., does not go off the grid).\n\nTo generate all possible paths of length k starting from a cell, we can use a recursive approach or a backtracking algorithm. The basic idea is to explore all possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current cell and recursively generate all possible paths of length k-1 starting from each of these cells.\n\nTo calculate the sum of the values of the cells in a path, we can simply iterate over the cells in the path and add their values.\n\nTo update the minimum path, we can compare the sum of the values of the cells in the current path with the sum of the values of the cells in the current minimum path.
