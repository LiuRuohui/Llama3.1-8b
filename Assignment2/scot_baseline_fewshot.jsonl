The input string is a sequence of groups separated by spaces, and each group is a sequence of parentheses.\n\n### Rough Solving Process\n\n1. **Sequence: Split the input string into groups**: We will split the input string into groups using the space character as a delimiter. This will give us a list of strings, each representing a group of parentheses.\n\n2. **Loop: Iterate over each group**: We will iterate over each group in the list and calculate the deepest level of nesting for that group.\n\n3. **Branch: Check if the group is valid**: Before calculating the deepest level of nesting, we need to check if the group is valid (i.e., it has balanced parentheses). If the group is not valid, we will skip it.\n\n3. **Sequence: Calculate the deepest level of nesting**: We will use a stack to calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group. We will push opening parentheses onto the stack and pop them off when we encounter a closing parenthesis. The maximum depth of the stack at any point will be the deepest level of nesting.\n\n4. **Output: Return the list of deepest levels of nesting**: Finally, we will return the list of deepest levels of nesting for each group.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.\n    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.\n    \n    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')\n    [2, 3, 1, 3]\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Split the input string into groups\n    groups = paren_string.split()\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the deepest levels of nesting\n    deepest_levels = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each group\n    for group in groups:\n        # Initialize a stack to calculate the deepest level of nesting\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Initialize the deepest level of nesting for the current group\n        deepest_level = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the group\n        for char in group:\n            # If the character is an opening parenthesis, push it onto the stack\n            if char == '(':\n                stack.append(char)\n            # If the character is a closing parenthesis, pop the opening parenthesis from the stack\n            elif char == ')':\n                stack.pop()\n                # If the stack is empty after popping, it means we have a balanced group\n                if not stack:\n                    # Update the deepest level of nesting for the current group\n                    deepest_level = max(deepest_level, len(stack) + 1)\n        \n        # Add the deepest level of nesting for the current group to the list\n        deepest_levels.append(deepest_level)\n    \n    # Return the list of deepest levels of nesting\n    return deepest_levels\n```\n\nThis code uses the three basic structures of sequences, branches, and loops to solve the problem of parsing nested parentheses and finding the deepest level of nesting for each group.",  "output": "from typing import List\n\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.\n    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.\n    E.g.

The prime factors should be listed in the order from smallest to largest, and each factor should be listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.\n\n### Rough Solving Process\n\n1. **Input**: Take an integer `n` as input.\n2. **Sequence**: Initialize an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors.\n3. **Loop**: Start a loop that continues until `n` is reduced to 1.\n4. **Branch**: Check if `n` is divisible by 2. If it is, then 2 is a prime factor, and we add 2 to the `factors` list. We then divide `n` by 2.\n5. **Branch**: If `n` is not divisible by 2, then we start checking from 3. We check if `n` is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of `n`. If it is, then that number is a prime factor, and we add it to the `factors` list. We then divide `n` by that number.\n6. **Loop**: Repeat steps 4 and 5 until `n` is reduced to 1.\n7. **Output**: Return the `factors` list.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.\n    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.\n    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors\n    >>> factorize(8)\n    [2, 2, 2]\n    >>> factorize(25)\n    [5, 5]\n    >>> factorize(70)\n    [2, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    i = 2\n    while n > 1:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return factors\n```\n\nThis code uses a loop to repeatedly check if `n` is divisible by the current number `i`.

The function `fruit_distribution` takes two inputs: a string `s` representing the number of apples and oranges, and an integer `n` representing the total number of fruits in the basket.\n2. We need to extract the number of apples and oranges from the string `s`. We can do this by splitting the string into two parts: the number of apples and the number of oranges.\n3.

This will give us a list of two strings: the number of apples and the number of oranges.\n\n**Sequence 2: Data Processing**\n\n1. We need to extract the actual numbers from the strings representing the number of apples and oranges. We can do this by using the `split()` function to split the strings into two parts: the number and the unit (e.g. \"5 apples\" becomes [\"5\", \"apples\"]).\n2. We can then convert the number to an integer using the `int()` function.\n3. We can add the number of apples and oranges to get the total number of non-mango fruits.\n\n**Branch 1: Calculate the Number of Mangoes**\n\n1.

If it does, we will add the coordinates (row, column) to the list.\n\n6. **Sequence: Sort the list of coordinates**\n   After finding all the coordinates of `x` in the list, we will sort the list first by row in ascending order, and then by column in descending order.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef get_row(lst, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,\n    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,\n    each row may contain a different number of columns.\n    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,\n    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that\n    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.\n    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.\n    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.\n    \n    Examples:\n    get_row([\n      [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\n    get_row([], 1) == []\n    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the coordinates\n    coordinates = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each row in the list\n    for i, row in enumerate(lst):\n        # Check if the row contains x\n        if x in row:\n            # Iterate over each column in the row\n            for j, col in enumerate(row):\n                # Check if the column contains x\n                if col == x:\n                    # Add the coordinates (row, column) to the list\n                    coordinates.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Sort the list of coordinates\n    coordinates.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n    \n    return coordinates\n```", "output": "def get_row(lst, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,\n    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,\n    each row may contain a different number of columns.\n    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,\n    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that\n    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.\n    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.\n    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.\n    \n    Examples:\n    get_row([\n      [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\n    get_row([], 1) == []\n    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    for i, row in enumerate(lst):\n        for j, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == x:\n                result.append((i, j))\n    result.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n    return result", "elapsed_time": 1.640232801437378, "token_count": 484}

The path of length k means visiting exactly k cells, not necessarily distinct.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Basic Structures**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the following basic structures:\n\n1. **Sequences**: We need to generate all possible paths of length k from each cell.\n2. **Branches**: We need to decide which cell to visit next based on the current path.\n3. **Loops**: We need to repeat the process of generating paths and deciding which cell to visit next until we find the minimum path.\n\n**Step 3: Write the Solving Process**\n\nHere is a high-level outline of the solving process:\n\n1. **Generate all possible paths of length k from each cell**:\n\t* For each cell, generate all possible paths of length k by moving to any of the neighbor cells.\n\t* Store the paths in a list.\n2. **Decide which cell to visit next based on the current path**:\n\t* For each path, decide which cell to visit next based on the current path.\n\t* Use a priority queue to store the paths based on their values.\n3. **Repeat the process until we find the minimum path**:\n\t* Repeat steps 1 and 2 until we find the minimum path.\n\n**Step 4: Implement the Solving Process**\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the solving process:\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    N = len(grid)\n    M = len(grid[0])\n    values = [i * N + j for i in range(N) for j in range(M)]\n    visited = set()\n    queue = []\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(M):\n            if (i, j) not in visited:\n                visited.add((i, j))\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (values[i * M + j], [(i, j)]))\n\n    for _ in range(k - 1):\n        while queue:\n            value, path = heapq.heappop(queue)\n            for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                x, y = path[-1][0] + dx, path[-1][1] + dy\n                if 0 <= x < N and 0 <= y < M and (x, y) not in visited:\n                    visited.add((x, y))\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (value + values[x * M + y], path + [(x, y)]))\n\n    return [path[-1][0] * M + path[-1][1] for path in queue]\n```\nThis implementation uses a priority queue to store the paths based on their values.
