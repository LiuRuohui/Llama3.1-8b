In this case, we need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns a list of its prime factors, with each factor appearing as many times as it appears in the factorization.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Concepts**\nThe key concepts here are prime numbers and factorization. A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1. Factorization is the process of breaking down a number into its prime factors.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Approach**\nTo solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We'll start with the smallest prime number (2) and keep dividing the input number by it as long as it's divisible. Then, we'll move on to the next prime number (3) and repeat the process. We'll keep doing this until the input number is reduced to 1.\n\n**Step 4: Handle Edge Cases**\nWe need to handle edge cases such as when the input number is less than 2 (in which case it's not a prime number) or when the input number is 1 (in which case its only factor is 1).\n\n**Step 5: Implement the Solution**\nWe'll write a function that takes an integer as input and returns a list of its prime factors.

We can use the built-in sort function in Python to sort the list.\n\n**Step 4: Write the Function**\nWe'll write a function that takes a list as input, sorts it, converts it to a set to remove duplicates, and then converts the set back to a list.

If we find a number that is greater than the current maximum, we update the maximum value.\n\n**Step 3: Choose a Starting Point**\nWe need to decide what to use as the initial maximum value.

A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\n**Step 2: Generate Fibonacci Numbers**\nTo solve this problem, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number. We can use a loop to generate these numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Check if a Number is Prime**\nFor each Fibonacci number, we need to check if it's a prime number. We can use a helper function to check if a number is prime.\n\n**Step 4: Keep Track of Prime Fibonacci Numbers**\nAs we generate Fibonacci numbers, we need to keep track of the ones that are also prime numbers. We can use a list or a counter to store these numbers.\n\n**Step 5: Return the nth Prime Fibonacci Number**\nOnce we have generated enough Fibonacci numbers, we can return the nth prime Fibonacci number.\n\n**Step 6: Handle Edge Cases**\nWe need to handle edge cases such as when n is 0 or a negative number.

In this case, we need to find three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.\n\n**Step 2: Think About the Approach**\nConsider how you can approach this problem. Since we're dealing with a list of integers, we can use a combination of mathematical operations and data structures to solve it. One possible approach is to use a two-pointer technique or a hash table to keep track of the elements we've seen so far.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Base Cases**\nThink about the edge cases that might make the problem easier to solve. For example, if the list has fewer than three elements, it's impossible to find three distinct elements that sum to zero. So, we can add a simple check at the beginning of the function to return False in this case.\n\n**Step 4: Sort the List (Optional)**\nSince we're looking for three distinct elements that sum to zero, we can sort the list in ascending order. This will make it easier to find the three elements, as we can use a two-pointer technique to find the first and last elements that sum to a certain value.\n\n**Step 5: Use a Two-Pointer Technique or Hash Table**\nOnce we have the sorted list, we can use a two-pointer technique or a hash table to find the three elements that sum to zero. The two-pointer technique involves moving two pointers, one from the start and one from the end of the list, towards each other until we find the three elements that sum to zero. The hash table approach involves storing the elements we've seen so far in a hash table and checking if the sum of any three elements is zero.\n\n**Step 6: Return the Result**\nOnce we've found the three elements that sum to zero, we can return True. If we've checked all possible combinations and haven't found three elements that sum to zero, we can return False.\n\nThat's a high-level overview of how to solve the problem. Of course, the actual implementation will depend on the specific approach you choose to use.\n+\n\ndef triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):\n    \"\"\"\n    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.\n    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that\n    sum to zero, and False otherwise.\n\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])\n    False\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])\n    True\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])\n    False\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])\n    True\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n", "output": "def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):\n    \"\"\"\n    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.\n    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that\n    sum to zero, and False otherwise.\n\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])\n    False\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])\n    True\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])\n    False\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])\n    True\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(l) < 3:\n        return False\n    l.sort()\n    for i in range(len(l) - 2):\n        left, right = i + 1, len(l) - 1\n        while left < right:\n            total = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]\n            if total == 0:\n                return True\n            elif total < 0:\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                right -= 1\n    return False", "elapsed_time": 4.774226427078247, "token_count": 708, "result": "passed", "passed": true}

These base cases will help us initialize our solution.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Recursive Formula**\nLook for the recursive formula that defines the sequence for larger inputs (n > 3).

The median is the middle value in a list of numbers when the numbers are arranged in order. If there are an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n**Step 2: Sort the List**\nTo find the median, we need to sort the list of numbers in ascending order. This will make it easier to find the middle value.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Middle Index**\nNext, we need to find the middle index of the sorted list. If the list has an odd number of values, the middle index is the index of the median value. If the list has an even number of values, the middle index is the index of the first of the two middle values.\n\n**Step 4: Handle Even and Odd Length Lists**\nWe need to handle two cases: when the list has an odd number of values and when it has an even number of values. If the list has an odd number of values, we can simply return the value at the middle index. If the list has an even number of values, we need to return the average of the two values at the middle index.\n\n**Step 5: Return the Median**\nFinally, we need to return the median value.

The function should return the result of `2^n` modulo `p`. In other words, it should calculate the remainder when `2^n` is divided by `p`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Concept**\nThe key concept here is the modulo operation, which is denoted by the `%` symbol. The modulo operation returns the remainder of an integer division.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Approach**\nTo solve this problem, you can use the built-in `pow` function in Python, which can calculate the power of a number. However, since we need to calculate `2^n` modulo `p`, we need to use the property of modular arithmetic that states `(a*b) % n = ((a % n) * (b % n)) % n`. This means we can calculate `2^n` modulo `p` by iteratively multiplying `2` by itself modulo `p`.\n\n**Step 4: Write the Function**\nUsing the approach identified in Step 3, you can write the `modp` function by initializing a variable to 2 and then iteratively multiplying it by itself modulo `p` for `n` times.\n\n**Step 5: Test the Function**\nFinally, you should test the `modp` function with different inputs to ensure it produces the correct results.\n+\n\ndef modp(n: int, p: int):\n    \"\"\"Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\n    >>> modp(3, 5)\n    3\n    >>> modp(1101, 101)\n    2\n    >>> modp(0, 101)\n    1\n    >>> modp(3, 11)\n    8\n    >>> modp(100, 101)\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n", "output": "def modp(n: int, p: int):\n    \"\"\"Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).\n    >>> modp(3, 5)\n    3\n    >>> modp(1101, 101)\n    2\n    >>> modp(0, 101)\n    1\n    >>> modp(3, 11)\n    8\n    >>> modp(100, 101)\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        result = (result * 2) % p\n    return result", "elapsed_time": 3.838759660720825, "token_count": 448, "result": "passed", "passed": true}

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Base Cases**\nTo solve this problem, you need to identify the base cases. In this case, the base cases are when `n` is 1 or 2, because the first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. When `n` is 1, the function should return 1, and when `n` is 2, the function should return 1.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Recursive Case**\nFor `n` greater than 2, the `n-th` Fibonacci number is the sum of the `(n-1)th` and `(n-2)th` Fibonacci numbers. This is the recursive case.\n\n**Step 4: Write the Recursive Function**\nUsing the base cases and the recursive case, you can write a recursive function that calculates the `n-th` Fibonacci number.\n\n**Step 5: Handle Large Inputs**\nHowever, recursive functions can be inefficient for large inputs because they create many function calls. To improve performance, you can use an iterative approach or memoization to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThat's the basic idea behind solving the Fibonacci problem!\n+\n\ndef fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return n-th Fibonacci number.\n    >>> fib(10)\n    55\n    >>> fib(1)\n    1\n    >>> fib(8)\n    21\n    \"\"\"\n", "output": "def fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return n-th Fibonacci number.\n    >>> fib(10)\n    55\n    >>> fib(1)\n    1\n    >>> fib(8)\n    21\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer\")\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)", "elapsed_time": 4.559890270233154, "token_count": 423, "result": "passed", "passed": true}

We can use a counter to keep track of the number of opening brackets that have not been closed yet.\n\n**Step 3: Initialize the Counter**\nWe need to initialize the counter to 0. This counter will keep track of the number of opening brackets that have not been closed yet.\n\n**Step 4: Iterate Through the String**\nWe need to iterate through the string of \"<\" and \">\".

For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is monotonically increasing. A list of numbers is monotonically decreasing if each number is less than or equal to the previous number. For example, `[4, 3, 2, 1]` is monotonically decreasing.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Conditions**\nTo determine if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, we need to check two conditions:\n\n* If the list is monotonically increasing, then each number in the list is greater than or equal to the previous number.\n* If the list is monotonically decreasing, then each number in the list is less than or equal to the previous number.\n\n**Step 4: Write the Logic**\nWe can write the logic for the `monotonic` function by iterating over the list and checking the conditions.

If the list is neither monotonically increasing nor decreasing, we return `False`.\n\n**Step 5: Handle Edge Cases**\nWe need to handle edge cases such as an empty list or a list with only one element.

If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we can check if we've seen an opening parenthesis that matches it. If we've seen an opening parenthesis that doesn't have a matching closing parenthesis, we can return False.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Key Elements**\nThe key elements in this problem are:\n\n* Opening parentheses: \"(\"\n* Closing parentheses: \")\"\n* Matching parentheses: an opening parenthesis followed by a closing parenthesis\n\n**Step 4: Develop the Algorithm**\nWe can use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening parentheses we've seen so far.

Since the intervals are closed, the intersection will also be a closed interval. To find the intersection, we need to find the maximum of the start values and the minimum of the end values.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Length of the Intersection**\nOnce we have the intersection, we need to calculate its length. The length of an interval (a, b) is simply b - a.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the Length is a Prime Number**\nWe need to write a function to check if a number is prime. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n**Step 5: Handle the Case Where the Intervals Don't Intersect**\nIf the intervals don't intersect, the length of the intersection will be 0, which is not a prime number.

This variable should be initialized to 1, because the product of any number with 1 is the number itself.\n\n5. **Iterate over the digits**: We need to iterate over each digit in the string representation of the integer. We can do this using a for loop.\n\n6. **Check if the digit is odd and update the product**: Inside the loop, we need to check if the digit is odd. If it is, we need to multiply the current product by the digit.\n\n7. **Return the product**: After iterating over all the digits, we need to return the product of the odd digits. If the product is 1, it means that all digits were even, so we should return 0.\n\n8. **Handle edge cases**: We need to make sure that our function works correctly for edge cases, such as when the input is 0 or a single-digit number.\n+\ndef digits(n):\n    \"\"\"Given a positive integer n, return the product of the odd digits.\n    Return 0 if all digits are even.\n    For example:\n    digits(1)  == 1\n    digits(4)  == 0\n    digits(235) == 15\n    \"\"\"\n", "output": "def digits(n):\n    \"\"\"Given a positive integer n, return the product of the odd digits.\n    Return 0 if all digits are even.\n    For example:\n    digits(1)  == 1\n    digits(4)  == 0\n    digits(235) == 15\n    \"\"\"\n    product = 1\n    for digit in str(n):\n        if int(digit) % 2 != 0:\n            product *= int(digit)\n    return product if product != 1 else 0", "elapsed_time": 3.905432939529419, "token_count": 476, "result": "failed: ", "passed": false}

In this case, you're a hungry rabbit who needs to eat a certain number of carrots to complete the day's meals. You already have eaten a certain number of carrots, and you need to figure out how many more carrots you need to eat and how many carrots will be left after your meals.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Variables**\nIdentify the key variables in the problem: `number` (the number of carrots you've already eaten), `need` (the number of carrots you need to eat), and `remaining` (the number of remaining carrots in stock).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Total Number of Carrots You Need to Eat**\nTo determine the total number of carrots you need to eat, you need to add the number of carrots you've already eaten (`number`) to the number of carrots you need to eat (`need`). This will give you the total number of carrots you need to eat to complete your meals.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Number of Carrots Left After Your Meals**\nTo determine the number of carrots left after your meals, you need to subtract the total number of carrots you need to eat from the number of remaining carrots in stock (`remaining`). However, if the total number of carrots you need to eat is greater than the number of remaining carrots in stock, you will eat all the remaining carrots, and the number of carrots left will be 0.\n\n**Step 5: Return the Result**\nReturn the result as an array of two values: the total number of carrots you need to eat and the number of carrots left after your meals.\n\nThat's it! By following these steps, you should be able to solve the problem.\n+\ndef eat(number, need, remaining):\n    \"\"\"\n    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,\n    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.\n    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,\n                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n    \n    Example:\n    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]\n    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]\n    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]\n    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]\n    \n    Variables:\n    @number : integer\n        the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n    @need : integer\n        the number of carrots that you need to eat.\n    @remaining : integer\n        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock\n    \n    Constrain:\n    * 0 <= number <= 1000\n    * 0 <= need <= 1000\n    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000\n\n    Have fun :)\n    \"\"\"\n", "output": "def eat(number, need, remaining):\n    \"\"\"\n    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,\n    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.\n    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,\n                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]\n    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.\n    \n    Example:\n    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]\n    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]\n    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]\n    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]\n    \n    Variables:\n    @number : integer\n        the number of carrots that you have eaten.\n    @need : integer\n        the number of carrots that you need to eat.\n    @remaining : integer\n        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock\n    \n    Constrain:\n    * 0 <= number <= 1000\n    * 0 <= need <= 1000\n    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000\n\n    Have fun :)\n    \"\"\"\n    total_eaten = number + need\n    if total_eaten <= remaining:\n        carrots_left = remaining - total_eaten\n    else:\n        carrots_left = 0\n    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]", "elapsed_time": 4.125762701034546, "token_count": 699, "result": "failed: Error", "passed": false}
