In this case, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1. So, we need to handle the base case where the input list is empty.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Recursive Case**\nIf the input list is not empty, we need to find a way to calculate the sum and product of all the integers in the list.

This means we need to take the given string and add as little as possible to the end of it to make it a palindrome.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Insight**\nThe key insight here is that a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, if we can find the longest postfix (suffix) of the given string that is a palindrome, we can use that to help us create the shortest palindrome.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Longest Palindromic Suffix**\nTo find the longest palindromic suffix, we need to start from the end of the string and work our way backwards, checking each substring to see if it's a palindrome. We can stop as soon as we find a palindrome, because we know that any longer suffix will be a prefix of the palindrome we found.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Prefix to Append**\nOnce we have the longest palindromic suffix, we need to find the prefix of the original string that comes before it. We can do this by taking the original string and removing the palindromic suffix from the end.\n\n**Step 5: Append the Reverse of the Prefix**\nFinally, we need to append the reverse of the prefix to the end of the original string.

For example, 5 is prime because the only numbers you can divide it by are 1 and 5 itself.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Edge Cases**\nWe need to think about what happens when the input number `n` is less than 2, because prime numbers are defined for positive integers greater than 1. We can decide that numbers less than 2 are not prime.\n\n**Step 4: Check for Divisibility**\nTo check if a number is prime, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can start by checking if the number is divisible by any number from 2 up to the square root of the number. If it is divisible, then it's not a prime number.\n\n**Step 5: Handle the Case Where the Number is 2**\nWe need to handle the special case where the input number is 2, because 2 is the only even prime number.\n\n**Step 6: Write the Function**\nNow that we have a clear understanding of the problem and the steps involved, we can start writing the function.

The `encode_cyclic` function should take a string as input and return a new string where groups of three characters are cycled. The `decode_cyclic` function should take a string encoded by `encode_cyclic` and return the original string.\n\n**Step 2: Break Down the Encoding Process**\nTo encode a string, we need to break it down into groups of three characters. If the string has fewer than three characters, we need to handle it specially.\n\n**Step 3: Cycle the Characters in Each Group**\nOnce we have the groups, we need to cycle the characters in each group. This means that the first character of each group should be moved to the end of the group.\n\n**Step 4: Handle Groups with Fewer Than Three Characters**\nIf a group has fewer than three characters, we don't need to cycle the characters. We can simply leave the group as it is.\n\n**Step 5: Join the Cycled Groups into a Single String**\nFinally, we need to join the cycled groups into a single string. This can be done using a string concatenation method.\n\n**Step 6: Understand the Decoding Process**\nTo decode a string, we need to reverse the encoding process.

We can use a helper function to check if a number is prime.\n\n**Step 4: Keep Track of Prime Fibonacci Numbers**\nAs we generate Fibonacci numbers, we need to keep track of the ones that are also prime numbers. We can use a list or a counter to store these numbers.\n\n**Step 5: Return the nth Prime Fibonacci Number**\nOnce we have generated enough Fibonacci numbers, we can return the nth prime Fibonacci number.\n\n**Step 6: Handle Edge Cases**\nWe need to handle edge cases such as when n is 0 or a negative number.

In this case, we need to find three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.\n\n**Step 2: Think About the Approach**\nConsider how you can approach this problem. Since we're dealing with a list of integers, we can use a combination of mathematical operations and data structures to solve it. One possible approach is to use a two-pointer technique or a hash table to keep track of the elements we've seen so far.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Base Cases**\nThink about the edge cases that might make the problem easier to solve. For example, if the list has fewer than three elements, it's impossible to find three distinct elements that sum to zero. So, we can add a simple check at the beginning of the function to return False in this case.\n\n**Step 4: Sort the List (Optional)**\nSince we're looking for three distinct elements that sum to zero, we can sort the list in ascending order. This will make it easier to find the three elements, as we can use a two-pointer technique to find the first and last elements that sum to a certain value.\n\n**Step 5: Use a Two-Pointer Technique or Hash Table**\nOnce we have the sorted list, we can use a two-pointer technique or a hash table to find the three elements that sum to zero. The two-pointer technique involves moving two pointers, one from the start and one from the end of the list, towards each other until we find the three elements that sum to zero. The hash table approach involves storing the elements we've seen so far in a hash table and checking if the sum of any three elements is zero.\n\n**Step 6: Return the Result**\nOnce we've found the three elements that sum to zero, we can return True. If we've checked all possible combinations and haven't found three elements that sum to zero, we can return False.\n\nThat's a high-level overview of how to solve the problem.

This is because the problem statement asks us to return a list.\n\n**Step 4: Iterate Over the Input List**\nWe will use a loop to iterate over each element in the input list. This loop will allow us to access each element one by one.\n\n**Step 5: Increment Each Element**\nInside the loop, we will add 1 to each element using the addition operator (+).\n\n**Step 6: Store the Result**\nWe will store the incremented element in a new list.\n\n**Step 7: Return the Result**\nFinally, we will return the new list containing the incremented numbers.\n\nThat's the basic idea behind solving this problem!\n+\n\ndef incr_list(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return list with elements incremented by 1.\n    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])\n    [2, 3, 4]\n    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]\n    \"\"\"\n+\nBased on the above knowledge, help me complete the prompt.\n Be attention, you should only output the codes without any explanation and natural language.\n Wrap your code with ``` ", "output": "def incr_list(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return list with elements incremented by 1.\n    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])\n    [2, 3, 4]\n    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]\n    \"\"\"\n    return [x + 1 for x in l]", "elapsed_time": 2.364802837371826, "token_count": 363, "result": "passed", "passed": true}

In this case, we need to find out if there are two distinct elements in a list that sum to zero.\n\n**Step 2: Think About the Approach**\nConsider how you can approach this problem. One way to do it is to use a brute-force approach, where we iterate through the list and check every pair of elements to see if they sum to zero.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Key Condition**\nIdentify the key condition that we need to check for. In this case, it's that the two elements must be distinct (i.e., not the same) and their sum must be zero.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Edge Cases**\nThink about edge cases that might affect our solution. For example, what if the list has only one element? What if the list has no elements? How will we handle these cases?\n\n**Step 5: Plan the Algorithm**\nPlan the algorithm that we will use to solve the problem.

The median is the middle value in a list of numbers when the numbers are arranged in order.

In other words, it should calculate the remainder when `2^n` is divided by `p`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Concept**\nThe key concept here is the modulo operation, which is denoted by the `%` symbol. The modulo operation returns the remainder of an integer division.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Approach**\nTo solve this problem, you can use the built-in `pow` function in Python, which can calculate the power of a number. However, since we need to calculate `2^n` modulo `p`, we need to use the property of modular arithmetic that states `(a*b) % n = ((a % n) * (b % n)) % n`.

The `decode_shift` function should take a string encoded by `encode_shift` and return the original string.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Shift Method**\nTo shift characters by 5 positions, we need to find the position of each character in the alphabet and add 5 to it.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Base Cases**\nTo solve this problem, you need to identify the base cases. In this case, the base cases are when `n` is 1 or 2, because the first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. When `n` is 1, the function should return 1, and when `n` is 2, the function should return 1.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Recursive Case**\nFor `n` greater than 2, the `n-th` Fibonacci number is the sum of the `(n-1)th` and `(n-2)th` Fibonacci numbers.

For example, `[4, 3, 2, 1]` is monotonically decreasing.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Conditions**\nTo determine if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, we need to check two conditions:\n\n* If the list is empty, it is considered monotonically increasing and decreasing.\n* If the list has only one element, it is considered monotonically increasing and decreasing.\n* If the list has more than one element, we need to check if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element (for increasing) or less than or equal to the previous element (for decreasing).\n\n**Step 4: Write the Logic**\nWe will use a loop to iterate through the list and check the conditions.

In this case, the largest prime factor is `n`.\n\nNow that we have the approach, we can start writing the code to implement it.\n+\n\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the largest prime factor of n.

This formula is a mathematical property that we can use to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Write the Function Signature**\nWe need to write the function signature, which includes the function name, input parameter, and return type. In this case, the function name is `sum_to_n`, the input parameter is `n`, and the return type is an integer.\n\n**Step 4: Implement the Formula**\nWe need to implement the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` inside the function.

If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we can check if we've seen an opening parenthesis that matches it. If we've seen an opening parenthesis that doesn't have a matching closing parenthesis, we can return False.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Key Elements**\nThe key elements in this problem are:\n\n* Opening parentheses: \"(\"\n* Closing parentheses: \")\"\n* Matching parentheses: an opening parenthesis followed by a closing parenthesis\n\n**Step 4: Develop the Algorithm**\nWe can use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening parentheses we've seen so far.

In this case, the prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (which is decimal 11), and D (which is decimal 13).\n\n**Step 3: Create a Function to Check for Prime Numbers**\nThink about how you can check if a number is prime. A prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. You can create a function that takes a number as input and returns True if it's prime, and False otherwise.\n\n**Step 4: Convert Hexadecimal Digits to Decimal**\nSince the input is a string of hexadecimal digits, you'll need to convert each digit to its decimal equivalent before checking if it's prime.

In this case, we need to find the intersection of two intervals and check if its length is a prime number.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Intersection of Two Intervals**\nThink about how to find the intersection of two intervals. Since the intervals are closed, the intersection will also be a closed interval. To find the intersection, we need to find the maximum of the start values and the minimum of the end values.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Length of the Intersection**\nOnce we have the intersection, we need to calculate its length. The length of an interval (a, b) is simply b - a.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the Length is a Prime Number**\nWe need to write a function to check if a number is prime. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n**Step 5: Handle the Case Where the Intervals Don't Intersect**\nIf the intervals don't intersect, the length of the intersection will be negative (since the start value of one interval is greater than the end value of the other).
